# Gits Project

  Our project consists of improving the implementation of the [Test Runner](https://github.com/uadyfmat/test-runner) project  in such a way that it is friendlier for the first semester students of the UADY Faculty of Mathematics, specifically those belonging to the degree in Software Engineering who are studying the subject of structured programming.

  The importance or usefulness of the project is reflected in the need to create a more friendly work environment for students who are in the first semester, considering that not all of them will have the necessary knowledge about the use of git and github that are required to use the Test Runner tool alone.
## General objective:

- Create a system that improves the implementation of the Test Runner tool in order to facilitate its use for the resolution, control and evaluation of practical programming exercises defined in the structured programming subject belonging to the educational program of the Bachelor of Software Engineering of the UADY, in such a way that it is more user-friendly without the need for prior knowledge of git and github.

## Specific objectives:

- Create a plugin or extension for Visual Studio Code that facilitates the handling of the Test Runner to the students belonging to the subject.
- Establish the necessary functionalities for the program to fulfill its mission.
- If time is available, implement an administrator-type version of the system that helps the teacher in charge in the control and monitoring of the activities carried out by the students.
## Users:

- ### Primary Users:

  The students and teachers belonging to the structured programming group of Dr. Edgar Cambranes.

- ### Potential Users:

  The students and teachers of all structured programming groups belonging to the UADY Software Engineering Degree.
